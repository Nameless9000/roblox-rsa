# Roblox RSA Authentication

This was a test demo of RSA authentication for external roblox http requests, this could be used in third party applications where it requires a trusted key.

By default this uses a weak 256 bit key for testing, this is incredibly insecure. A 1024+ bit key is recommended as a minimum.
